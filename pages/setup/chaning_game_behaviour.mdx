# Changing game behaviour!
So, you already made a project... now what? Well let's try changing some game values like **Player Speed**! For that we are gonna code in **GDScript**.
```gd filename="speed.gd" {3} copy
var walk_speed = 3.2
```

But what if you want to change something like **Player Gravity**? Well, for that we would need to code in **C#**, since **GRAVITY** is a constant.

```gd filename="gravity.gd" {3} copy
const GRAVITY = 32.0
```

For now we are gonna be changing stuff in **GDScript**, since it's easier for beginners & you don't need it for stuff like LureRefreshed.

# Setting up your Mod Files
So, right now, your **WEBFISHING** file system should look like this:

**res://**
- **Assets**
- **Resources**
- **Scenes**
- **Sounds**
- **default_bus_layout.tres**
- **default_env.tres**
- **icon.png**
- **interactable.gd**

Add a new folder to the **'res://'** called "mods". Add another folder to the **'mods'** folder called **'YourName.YourModName'**.
This is where you are gonna be storing all your stuff for the mod.

Add a new file called, **'main.gd'** (**It doesn't need to be called main it could be called whatever you like!**).

In Godot press **Project -> Project Settings -> AutoLoad -> Set Path: Your main.gd path, NodeName: Basically 'YourName.YourModName' but without the dot, so 'YourNameYourModName'**.
This will make it so everytime WEBFISHING opens with this mod, it will automatically start **'main.gd'**

# Downloading Dependencies
To get the player node, we can't just say **"hey computer give me player"**, we need to somehow find him.
So, we will use BlueberryWolf's APIs for that!

> ðŸ’« Download BlueberryWolf's APIs: https://github.com/BlueberryWolf/APIs/archive/refs/heads/main.zip
Unzip **BlueberryWolf's APIs (APIs-main.zip)**. Create a new folder in your **'/mods/'** folder, called **'BlueberryWolfi.APIs'**
and put all of the **'BlueberryWolf's APIs'** contents into the **'/mods/BlueberryWolfi.APIs'** 

Since **'BlueberryWolfi.APIs'** has **'main.gd'** too, we need to autoload it too. So go back and do the same thing for **'BlueberryWolfi.APIs'**, the NodeName for this will be:
**'BlueberryWolfiAPIs'**.

# Using Dependencies
Okay, now let's try getting the player.

```gd filename="main.gd" {3} copy
extends Node

var PlayerAPI # Create an empty variable called PlayerAPI.

func _ready(): # When mod starts
	PlayerAPI = get_node_or_null("/root/BlueberryWolfiAPIs/PlayerAPI") # Get PlayerAPI from BlueberryWolfiAPIs
	PlayerAPI.connect("_player_added", self, "init_player") # When a player gets added into a lobby (You)

func init_player(player: Actor): # When player gets added run this code
	# Nothing for now.
    pass
```

# GDScript
Let's try changing the player speed to 32.

```gd filename="main.gd" {3} copy
extends Node

var PlayerAPI # Create an empty variable called PlayerAPI.

func _ready(): # When mod starts
	PlayerAPI = get_node_or_null("/root/BlueberryWolfiAPIs/PlayerAPI") # Get PlayerAPI from BlueberryWolfiAPIs
	PlayerAPI.connect("_player_added", self, "init_player") # When a player gets added into a lobby (You)

func init_player(player: Actor): # When player gets added, run this code:
    # The 'player' variable, is the Player Node. (This has all the Player related stuff, ofc.)
	player.walk_speed = 32 # This sets the walk_speed to 32!
```

# C#
